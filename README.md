Features
TODO Add the following features

- Re style
- Adjust sizing for mobile users
- Editible tabs
- Add progress line that runs through the tab (hovers over the note that its playing)
- Add bends and slides (probably by using a library to adjust audio pitch and adjusting it over a period of time to create a bend effect, this would also make it so you only need one sound per instrument and can edit it in realtime to create any pitch)
- Create your own tabs
- Add more instruments
- Change BPM at a particular spot
- Change timing eg 3/4 time, 4/4 time etc
- Change timing ^ at particular spot
- Be able to upload custom instrument sounds
- Save use created tabs to local storage
- Save tabs to PDFs
- Potentially create a backend so users can register and save multile tabs to their account
