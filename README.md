# Guitar Tab Writer

TODO Write this

Features
TODO Add the following features

- Multiple instruments playing at the same time
- Switch the view between different instruments
- Have the current Instrument play slightly louder than the others
- Re style
- Fix sizing : add a max width to the chart so it doesn't look stupid on a big monitor
- Adjust sizing for mobile users
- Editible tabs
- Add bends and slides (probably by using a library to adjust audio pitch and adjusting it over a period of time to create a bend effect, this would also make it so you only need one sound per instrument and can edit it in realtime to create any pitch)
- Create your own tabs
- Add more instruments
- Change BPM at a particular spot
- Change timing eg 3/4 time, 4/4 time etc
- Change timing ^ at particular spot
- Be able to upload custom instrument sounds
- Save use created tabs to local storage
- Save tabs to PDFs
- Potentially create a backend so users can register and save multile tabs to their account
